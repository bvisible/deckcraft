# Neoffice fork markers

Map of **our** divergence from upstream (`storytold/deckcraft`) in this fork (`bvisible/deckcraft`, branch
`version-15`). Everything that can carry a comment carries a `//// Neoffice — …` marker in place:
`// //// Neoffice — …` in Rust (a bare `////` is an error for clippy), `# //// Neoffice — …` in TOML
and YAML, `<!-- //// Neoffice — … -->` in Markdown. This file holds the base of the divergence and
what cannot carry a comment.

At the next upstream merge, `grep -rn "////"` in the source plus this file give the complete
picture of what is ours and why.

- **Upstream**: `storytold/deckcraft`, branch `main`.
- **Base of the divergence**: `688c7ef592c901ca4541c25e210c1b302e4dc066`, the tag `v0.6.1`, where `version-15` was cut on 2026-10-13.
  Move it at each upstream merge. The check works it out itself (the common ancestor with
  upstream's `main`), so this line is for the reader.

## What the fork adds

Two workflow files, both new files that carry their own `//// Neoffice — added file` header. No
file of upstream's is changed.

- `.github/workflows/neoffice-web.yml`: builds the browser version on a GitHub runner, started by
  hand, with the packaging script upstream's own release job runs. Upstream's workflows are
  disabled on this fork, because they need upstream's signing secrets.
- `.github/workflows/neoffice-markers.yml`: fails a push to `version-15` when a change to
  upstream's code since the common ancestor carries no marker.

## Files that cannot carry a comment

None so far.
